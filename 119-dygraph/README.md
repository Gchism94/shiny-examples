The dygraphs package provides the dygraphOutput and renderDygraph functions to enable use of [dygraphs](http://dygraphs.com) within Shiny applications and R Markdown interactive documents.

Note that using dygraphs with Shiny requires a recent version of the Shiny package (>= 0.10.2.1) so you should be sure to update Shiny before trying out dygraphs with it.
